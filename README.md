# odin-landing-page

Built to demonstrate an understanding of flexbox. 

This was a lot of fun to build. I struggled a bit in the beginning but as I went, things just started to click into place and it worked! I don't know if the sections were intentionally spaced out to be easier towards the bottom, or if I was just getting more comfortable as I went. Probably a combination of both.

Either way I feel 10000x more confident using flexbox now, and I can't wait to build some things without external specifications.
